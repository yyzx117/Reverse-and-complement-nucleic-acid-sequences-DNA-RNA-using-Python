# Reverse-and-complement-nucleic-acid-sequences-DNA-RNA-using-Python

By the end of this project, you will create a Python program that constructs reverse, complement, and reverse-complement nucleic acid sequences (DNA, RNA) using Spyder Pythoon. Finally you will learn how to read a file that has a long DNA sequence and then apply the code to the data in the file. We will use the novel coronavirus genome for this. Along the way, you will learn the basic building blocks in the Python language.
